The theme used on this site,"Marat", is heavily inspired by [L'Ami du peuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Ami_du_peuple), a newspaper written by [Jean-Paul Marat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Marat) during the French Revolution.  Thus it may not be used to promote any form of totalitarianism, and should rather be used to advance democracy and revive the Age of Reason.
