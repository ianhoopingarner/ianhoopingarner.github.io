What seems like a long time ago but was really February of last year, during the Flint water crisis, I wrote a comment — on a blog I managed to convince my academic administrator to accept as a term paper — mentioning that where reporters investigations and academic research concurred was that the people of Flint were not alone. Amid the panic and uncertainty about the future, a bracing fact that accompanied the tragedy was that the people of Flint became connected to the many and various people in Michigan, the nation, and beyond that are witnessing the privatization of what is more than a resource, but is quite literally the component of life. 
Since, the corporate tendencies of government, unchecked administrative power, have swung even further to the American political right-wing, where control has been consolidated by an monied minority of commercial and financial brokers. Bloomberg, the news site, had an article about Wilber Ross that heralded the onset of “billionaire rule”. There is still some opposition in Congress speaking out against the growing monopolization — Ro Khanna is, to his credit. Monopoly consolidation is markedly prevalent in the “new” internet economy — the one that caused so much “end of history” jubilee in the 90’s before the growth of Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft out of the primordial soup of the early Internet. 
As with the rest of the economy, a lot of it is being deregulated or not regulated. That online shopping has expanded to such an extent that there are requests of delivery for almost any item shows of the waste produced by this commercial practice. The supply chain of global business and trade is a major emitter of fossil fuels. Aside from adjustments in the course of doing business, adjusting to the price of fuel and so forth, it is scarcely evident that the shipping industry has given long term consideration towards its various effluents emitted. 


 ##Telesur: Flint is part of a greater struggle for water rights
#### 2016-02-03
Kari Lyderson at TelesurTV.net has a great piece on the Flint water crisis that everyone should read. She very persuasively argues that Flint is but one puzzle piece in a wider struggle over water rights in the state of Michigan. Here’s an especially cogent section:
>…residents and watchdogs are still trying to figure out the full story behind the maneuvers, and many think that privatizing Flint’s water system was the ultimate goal.
>The multi-national French water company Veolia was hired by the emergency manager and paid $900 an hour to analyze Flint’s water system last year, for a total of almost $40,000. Global Exchange describes Veolia as the “largest water privatization business in the world.”  In Detroit, Veolia was also hired to evaluate the water system, at the same time a new regional water authority was created that many saw as priming the pump for privatization.

Veolia Water North America has, incidentally, had ample opportunity to prove that they can successfully manage a city-wide water treatment and distribution system — but their record is not good. Their highest-profile failure was their attempt to manage Indianapolis, IN’s municipal water system, a private venture that failed after the company was [investigated for “water quality concerns”](http://www.wthr.com/story/3927046/veolia-water-indianapolis-under-investigation). Subsequently, the company [lost their contract.](http://www.ibj.com/articles/23102-veolia-losing-water-contract-will-get-29m-termination-fee)

Lyderson continues:
>More than 30,000 Detroit residents have had their water shut off since 2013, when the water authority began aggressively pursuing people behind on their bills and turned over enforcement to a private agency.
To rub salt in the wound, some residents were charged exorbitant bills for water that leaked or poured out of damaged pipes, often ruptured by copper theft, age, or other factors beyond the residents’ control. And since water debts are added to property tax bills, the water crisis has forced families to lose their homes to foreclosure, gutted the value of their homes, and put them at risk of having their children removed by state authorities.
Many wonder whether water infrastructure in Flint, Detroit and other cities has been allowed to degrade intentionally or tacitly in order to open the way for a private operator to take over. Similar scenarios have played out in other parts of the world; for example in El Salvador a decade ago, and famously with the “water war” in Cochabamba, Bolivia, in 2000.

In El Salvador, an Inter-American Development Bank loan that was accepted by the government forced the country to privatize its water system, but poor service and brown water lead people to [impassioned protest](http://upsidedownworld.org/main/el-salvador-archives-74/445-not-for-sale-el-salvadors-movement-against-water-privatization), eventually leading to a reclamation of public utilities by a state-administered, unionized water system. In Cochabamba, a city in central Bolivia, a “private, foreign-led consortium” of water privateers, lead by the US corporation Bechtel, tried to privatize the city’s water, even [installing meters](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/04/08/leasing-the-rain) on community-owned wells, before massive protests drove them out of the country.

and Lyderson again:
>“It’s all about money, it’s about greed, it’s a perfect example of environmental racism,” in Flint and Detroit, said Peggy Case, president of the group Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation (MCWC). “This would not be happening in Traverse City where I live, it would not be happening in Bloomfield Hills or Ann Arbor.”

Dr. Robert Bullard of Texas Southern University has a similar [reflection on the situation](http://rockrivertimes.com/2016/01/22/flints-water-crisis-is-a-blatant-example-of-environmental-injustice/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter):
>Unequal protection is a reality. The right to clean air, clean water and safe places for kids to play is something that affluent communities take for granted. But many low-income and minority communities don’t get parks, or street lights, or housing code enforcement, or safe drinking water. The cumulative environmental stresses in these neighborhoods create a toxic stew. And then government agencies don’t respond when people complain. The government’s nonresponse to Flint’s water crisis is on the scale of the federal nonresponse to Hurricane Katrina.

Dr Bullard mentions that Hurricane Katrina [was leveraged](http://www.democracynow.org/2015/8/28/shock_doctrine_a_look_at_the) to push through previously rejected privatization schemes.
