The two investors in Spartan PV1 have <a href="https://renewablesnow.com/news/alterra-power-secures-financing-for-11-mw-us-solar-plant-578966/">secured a loan</a> from an Indiana-based bank to finance project construction.

<p class="intro">Alterra Power Corp. is the principal investor in Spartan PV1, the corporation building an 11MW solar array across several MSU parking lots.  Alterra holds a majority interest of "at least" 85% in Spartan PV1.  The rest of the shares are owned by Inovateus Solar LLC.</p>

<p class="intro">Inovateus is known to the area, as they worked with the City of East Lansing to establish the Spartan PV1 corporation and to negotiate the power purchase agreement with MSU.  But what about the other, larger investor?</p>

Alterra's role in the venture is to provide funding.  The Vancouver-based renewable energy company was formed in 2011 through the merger of Plutonic Power Corp. and Magma Energy Corp.  Recently the company has been expanding into renewables like wind and more recently solar, but most of the company's investments around the world are in hydroelectricity and geothermal.

The most noteworthy prior Alterra investment is likely the takeover of HS Orka, a large Icelandic geothermal company, acquired by Magma Energy Corp in 2010.  At the time of [Magma's purchase of Orka](http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/magma-energy-corp-to-hold-9853-of-iceland-geothermal-energy-producer-hs-orka-tsx-mxy-1261015.htm), the geothermal plant produced 9% of the Iceland's power.  

The HS Orka takeover was opportunistically carried out as Iceland was going through a financial crisis caused by the de-regulation of its financial institutions.  Controversy erupted over the sale: reports of [other buyers](http://icelandreview.com/news/2011/09/09/century-aluminum-also-made-bid-share-hs-orka) making offers on the plant later surfaced, and musician Bjork [vocally opposed](http://www.financialpost.com/Iceland+wants+reverse+Magma+deal+Bjork/4140726/story.html) the intrusion of "banksters" foreign and domestic into geothermal, which is part of Iceland's public domain.  Prior to the financial collapse, HS Orka had been privatized, and the sale to Magma Energy was carried out through a Swedish shell company.  In the sale, Magma Corp. acquired 98.5% of the geothermal producer.

Responsive to public demands, Icelandic pension funds made offers to [buy back](http://icelandreview.com/news/2011/11/15/icelandic-state-reclaim-hs-orka-magma-energy) some of HS Orka from Magma Energy in 2011.  When Magma sold 25% of HS Orka back to Iceland's retirees, it made 8.06 billion Icelandic Krona (US$68 million).  In 2010 Magma had paid 10.56 billon krona for almost all of HS Orka.  

In its own words, when it sold a fraction of the geothermal company back to Iceland, the Canadian company's earnings were "approximately equal to Magmaâ€™s original cost of acquisition".  The whole deals appears to amount to a highly profitable and ethically suspect manipulation of the global political economy.  Around this time, Magma merged with Plutonic Power Corp. to form Alterra.  Alterra, as Magma's successor, still owns a majority stake in the Icelandic power company to this day.

The loan that Alterra has been granted by 1st Source Bank in South Bend, IN, has several components.  [As per the press release](https://renewablesnow.com/news/alterra-power-secures-financing-for-11-mw-us-solar-plant-578966/):

>The loan was granted by 1st Source Bank, a subsidiary of 1st Source Corporation (NASDAQ:SRCE) and is comprised of a USD-19.8-million construction loan and a USD-500,000 letter of credit. 1st Source will also provide a USD-9.7-million tax equity investment commitment and a USD-10.2-million term loan commitment, both of which will go to retire the construction loan facility commercial operations start. (*sic*) The term loan will have a balloon payment based on a 6-year maturity and 20-year amortisation.
