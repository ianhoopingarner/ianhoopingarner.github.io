Michigan State University has recently signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Spartan PV1, LLC, a group of private investors which will own a 15,000 MWh solar installation on five campus parking lots.  The terms of a PPA expire after a period of time agreed upon by both parties, but the university is interested in continuing to use solar power.  After this 25-year agreement period is concluded, MSU is “keeping all options open,” physics professor and project advisor Dr. Wolfgang Bauer said.</p>

Common [options after the expiration of a PPA](https://us.sunpower.com/sites/sunpower/files/media-library/white-papers/wp-why-power-purchase-agreements-make-sense.pdf) are for the host consumer to buy the installation, or to extend the contract.  In some cases the host may want to cancel the agreement and have the PPA partner disassemble and remove the equipment.  But MSU is “definitely planning to run the array after the initial 25 years,” according to Bauer, and with commercially available panels predicted to become even more efficient in coming years, the university may even “replace the panels after 10-15 years and save money.”  

In March, researchers in Japan set [a new record](https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-have-broken-the-record-for-solar-panel-efficiency-again) for efficiency in mass-produced solar panels.  The previous record was set in 2015, and the new design from the Osaka-based team reaches a maximum sunlight-to-electricity conversion rate of 26.6%.  These researchers for the Kaneko company are approaching the [theoretical conversion efficiency limit](https://www.nature.com/articles/nenergy201732) for silicon-based solar cells, which might be around 29%.  

However, other efficiency improvements such as sun-tracking mirrors that focus light and filters that capture bandwidths of sunshine that are not normally captured, have raised the limits of solar panel efficiency to new heights.  An Australian research team at the University of New South Wales produced an array using these modification that achieved more than [40% conversion efficiency](https://www.sciencealert.com/australian-researchers-have-converted-sunlight-into-electricity-with-more-than-40-efficiency).  

Spartan PV1’s panels, with 16-17% efficiency, are toward the high end of the consumer market for now.

The solar array offers an opportunity for MSU faculty to work on issues related to integrating renewable energy sources with the electric grid.  Renewable energy has [variable](http://new.abb.com/substations/energy-storage-applications/capacity-firming) output over time, while a well-maintained grid system requires a steady supply of electricity.  

One of the documents submitted to the City of East Lansing was a table that showed Inovateus's predictions of how the solar array will lose value over time.   While the economic value of the whole installation will be reduced to 23% of the original in 15 years, it is likely that the projected depreciation is not strongly corelated with a predicted decrease in the solar energy captured by the system.  

The system will stay relatively efficient over time; such a decrease would be minimal.  According to Professor Bauer, who was asked about the solar cells' efficiency a decade from now - at that time the developer predicts the system to be worth 36% of its original price - the solar array will be capturing only a little less electricity.  “The panels of this type are projected to lose about 0.5% of their capacity per year,” Bauer said.  “Therefore, they are expected to still produce 95% of their nameplate capacity in a decade from now.”
