Hurricane Harvey had a strange effect on the news.  Suddenly the tone has shifted to a bland sort of acknowledgement that climate change is real, combined with a strong 
belief of dubious truth -- that *this* and only this, preferably on network TV -- is what climate change will be like -- we understand it all!

* CNN has decided that [now][cnn] is when watchers of television and readers of their website should know what climate change looks like -- it looks exactly like Harvey, they say.  -- but sarcasm aside it also appears that the concept of stronger storms as a consequence of global warming has now entered the frame of the Overton window.  
* How strong was the storm?  MLive postulates that if all the water that fell there fell into the Great Lakes, the entire lake system would rise by [eleven and a half feet][mlive].
* The Guardian posted an opinion essay that climate scientist Michael Mann [wrote during the storm][mann], explaining one of the the mysterious factors that observers say caused such severe flooding.  The warmer surface temperatures in the ocean and the expanded subtropical high pressure system stationary over middle America combined and kept the storm lingering at length in the sky above Houston, depositing enough rain to cause the [worst flooding in Houston's recorded history][flooding].  Both are climate change effects long predicted by computer monitoring and modeling software.  
* Politico too wants to declare than Harvey is the literal picture of [what a climate changed looks like][politico], stating that “the weather has always been political” while also noting the symbolism of the storm’s target: “The sprawled-out capital city of America’s oil industry”.
* Rolling Stone wants us to [pay attention to a couple facts][rolling stone]: that Houston is the largest city in the US with no zoning laws whatsoever, and, since 2010 in Houston (a year, by the way, when the Texas House of Representatives swung a [2/3 majority in the Republican Party’s favor][texashouse]) more than 7,000 residential buildings have been constructed on flood plains that FEMA had marked as being likely to flood every 100 years.
* Yes, it is ironic  that president Trump [rescinded standards for climate adaptation in infrastructure][latimes] not too long before the storm hit.  (He doesn't seem very sensitive to irony.)
* But the in-depth political context is about the zoning standards, or rather Houston's lack thereof, and how consequently the wild bonanza in Houston's unregulated developer market disrupted wetland and coastal ecosystems, paving over natural features that would have the area more resilient in downpour or deluge.  When Al-Jazeera English reporter Shihab Rattansi tried to mention this on a [live MSNBC broadcast][rattansi], there was an *unfortunate* incident where the studio cut away from Rattansi's audio feed.  After getting back on-air, the AJE journalist mentioned that ProPublica had done an [investigation on this exact topic][propublica1] about a year ago, [recently followed up in the wake of the storm][propublica2], and that despite the amount of money generated by Houston’s oil industry, funding for storm preparation was inadequate.  “Texas politicians have a lot to answer for--" said Rattansi, at which point another curious audio malfunction ended the segment...  

Perhaps one day we will know what Rattansi meant to say before the silence, but until then could we hypothesize similarity to [the very detailed report by Josh Harkinson in the Houston Press describing how developers benefited from both an enforcement structure overpowered by corporate money and interpretations that limited "jurisdictional" status on wetlands to few areas, and unrestrained, sprawled over Houston's wetlands and coastal prairie in the mid-2000s][draintheswamp]?

*also its worth mentioning*
